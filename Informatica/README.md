# Informatica Conversion example
This repository contains Informatica "Conversion Rules" code samples that use groovy and [**Control-M Self Conversion API**](https://docs.bmc.com/docs/ctmselfconv/control-m-self-conversion-api-814570051.html) to convert sample Informatica input data into Control-M Data.<br> 
You can use these Informatica Conversion Rules code samples to convert your Informatica data to Control-M data, or use them as an example in using the [**Control-M Self Conversion API**](https://docs.bmc.com/docs/ctmselfconv/control-m-self-conversion-api-814570051.html) to create Control-M Informatica jobs.

### The Informatica Conversion example includes:
* __SampleData.xml__ - Informatica sample data in XML format. [(Informatica data extraction)](https://github.com/controlm/self-conversion-api-community-solutions/tree/master/Informatica#extract-informatica-data-in-xml-format)
* __MappingLogic.xlsx__ - Holds the mapping logic used in this sample to convert from Informatica data to Control-M data.
* __Informatica_ConversionRules.json__ - The Informatica Conversion Rules json file that holds the Self Conversion rules code samples.
* __ControlM_Result.xml__ - The Control-M data created by the Self-Conversion when converting the Informatica sample data using the Informatica conversion rules sample.
* __HelixControlM_Result.json__ - The Helix Control-M data created by the Helix Control-M Self-Conversion when converting the Informatica sample data using the Informatica conversion rules sample.

### XML structure sample:
```xml 
<BOX>
  <JOB Name="JOB1">Job Text</JOB>
</BOX> 
```
 __Above sample contains:__
* BOX Element that has a child JOB Element. 
* JOB Element contains a "Name" attribute with value "JOB1"
* JOB Element text value is "Job Text"

### Informatica mapping logic  
| Informatica Data | Control-M Data |
| --- | --- |
| WORKFLOW Element | Smart Folder |
| WORKFLOW "NAME" Attribute | Smart Folder Name |
| WORKLET Element | Sub Folder Definition |
| WORKLET "NAME" Attribute | Sub Folder Name |
| TASK Element with Attribute TYPE="Command" | OS Job Definition |
| TASK "NAME" Attribute | Job Name |
| TASK "DESCRIPTION" Attribute | Job Description |
| TASK > VALUEPAIR "VALUE" Attribute | OS Job Command value |
| TASK Element with Attribute TYPE="start" | Dummy job Definition |
| SESSION Element | Informatica Job Definition |
| SESSION "NAME" Attribute | Informatica Job Name |
| SESSION "DESCRIPTION" Attribute | Informatica Job Description |
| WORKFLOWLINK Element | Declare dependency between two entities  |
| WORKFLOWLINK "FROMTASK" Attribute | Name of the Entity that raise Out Condition |
| WORKFLOWLINK "TOTASK" Attribute | Name of the Entity that accept In Condition |
| REPOSITORY "NAME" Attribute | Informatica Job Host/Host Group |
| FOLDER "NAME" Attribute | Informatica Job Repository Folder Name |
| WORKFLOW "NAME" Attribute | Informatica Job Run Single Task |
| TASKINSTANCE "TASKNAME" Attribute | Reference to the Job/Sub-Folder Definition |
| TASKINSTANCE Element | Job/Sub-Folder Instance |
| WORKFLOW > TASKINSTANCE | Job/Sub-Folder is under  a Smart Folder |
| WORKLET > TASKINSTANCE | Job/Sub-Folder is under a Sub-Folder |

### Usage Instructions
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open Control-M Self Conversion.
3. Import the __Informatica Conversion Rules__ json file.
4. Create a new Self Conversion project: 
   * Enter a project name.
   * Load the **Informatica Sample Input Data**.
   * In "Use existing conversion rules" dropdown list, select the conversion rules imported in step 3.
   * Click "Create Project".
5. Click Run.
6. Review the conversion results.

## Contribution guide
To contribute, please follow these guidelines.

### Files, folders and naming conventions
1. Every conversion and its associated files must be contained in its own **folder**. Name this folder as the name of the tool that you convert from.
2. The __folder__ should contain:
   * __SampleData__ - A folder that holds tool sample Input Data in XML format that we want to convert to Control-M data.
   * __MappingLogic.xlsx__ - The mapping logic used for conversion in this sample, from the  tool sample input data to Control-M data.
   * __Informatica_ConversionRules.json__ - The tool Conversion Rules json file that contains the Self Conversion rules code.
   * __ControlM_Result.xml__ - The Control-M data created by the Self Conversion when converting the tool sample data using the Demo Tool conversion rules.
   * __HelixControlM_Result.json__ - The Helix Control-M data created by the Helix Control-M Self-Conversion when converting the tool sample data using the Demo Tool conversion rules. 

3. Include a **README.md** file that explains the sample. A good description helps other community members to understand your sample. The README.md uses [Github Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for formatting text.
