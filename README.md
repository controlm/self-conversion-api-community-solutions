## Contribution guide
To contribute, please follow these guidelines.

### Files, folders and naming conventions
1. Every conversion and its associated files must be contained in its own **folder**. Name this folder as the name of the tool that you convert from.
2. The __folder__ should contain:
   * __SampleData__ - A folder that holds tool sample Input Data in XML format that we want to convert to Control-M data.
   * __MappingLogic.xlsx__ - The mapping logic used for conversion in this sample, from the  tool sample input data to Control-M data.
   * __ConversionRules.json__ - The tool Conversion Rules json file that contains the Self Converion rules code.
   * __ControlM_Result.xml__ - The Control-M data created by the Self Converion when converting the tool sample data using the Demo Tool conversion rules.
   * __HelixControlM_Result.json__ - The Helix Control-M data created by the Helix Control-M Self-Conversion when converting the tool sample data using the Demo Tool conversion rules. 

3. Include a **README.md** file that explains the sample. A good description helps other community members to understand your sample. The README.md uses [Github Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for formatting text.
